<!-- em and rem relative css units that are relative to font size  or viewport
 em are relative to parent font size normally,
 1em = 16px (on zoom =100%, and if parent is body)
 1em copy or same font size of parent .
 em hav demerit of it relative to parent and if parent is child of another element it causes multiplication effect.

so we can use rem which is const relative to html element(to change the basic font size change font size of parent)

â­• font-size use rem
â­• padding and margin use em
â­• width em or percentage, also some time use pixel

ðŸš©if the font size of parent(body) is not mentioned and 
h1{
font size: 24 px;
margin: 2 em;
}

value of margin will  2*24 = 48px (even parent font size is mentioned)

 ---------------------------------  ---------------------------------
 percentage are written relative to its parent properties
 
 max width can be used for container can used to increase space in large screen (to avoid large picture and comparatively lesser text)
 .container{
 width:90%;
 max width:620px;
 min width:500px;(optionally used)
 } 
 below 620 px it become responsively adjusting to 90% of screen width . below 500px it enables scrolling bar other wise it become highly shrink picture
 
 if we apply only max width when the size of screen decreases to less than the max width the size of div adjust to max size of the screen-->
 <!-- ---------------------------------  --------------------------------- -->

<!-- div's are block element and usually take 100% of width(even we change width it does not going become flex or inline) , where as span is inline  
 -- margin auto auto can used align content center and margin 0 auto can used to align the content centre horizontally
 -- for image use max width 100% for prevent change in length more than the actual width of image
 -- justify content space between can used to insert space it uses extra space and insert equally 
 -- align items stretch can used to stretch the container and use 100% width
 -- to flex both horizontal and vertical we can use flex start in align items and display flex
 -- align items base line make text content of container starting lies on same line

MEDIA QUERIES
 
@ media screen and ({condition}){

}
examples of {condition} = 
max width = 400px => upto 400 px apply this style
min width = 400px => while the size  of screen decreases and reach upto 400 px apply this style

@media (condition) can also used
@media print{} is used to make changes when the page is taken for print
@media (max-width=600px;){}is generally used

media query should come after default selector in the page, that is why generally media query is written at bottom of file.
---------------------------------  ---------------------------------
NAV

general structure
<nav>
    <ul>
        <li><a href=""></a></li>
        <li><a href=""></a></li>
        <li><a href=""></a></li>
    </ul>
</nav>

generally inside the nave the buttons to other pages are written title and icon of page are written with nav element in the header tag.
to separate the title and nav to the end(2 items to the end of a div) we can use justify content : space-between 
for responsive nav use change the screen size and select one (675px)
